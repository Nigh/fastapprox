Version 0.2.0
  * 10% faster fastdigamma/vfastdigamma (same formula with terms rearranged)
  * handle underflow in fastexp (25% speed penalty, but ubiqituous so necessary)

Version 0.1.0
  * Inverse erf
  * Trade some overall log accuracy to improve accuracy on exact powers of 2
  * Whoops, left out power 

Version 0.0.0
