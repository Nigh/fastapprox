Version 0.3.2
  * fix some compile warnings

Version 0.3.1
  * somewhat faster fasterlog
  * Lambert W, use negative exponential in Halley's method

Version 0.3.0
  * Lambert W

Version 0.2.0
  * 10% faster fastdigamma/vfastdigamma (same formula with terms rearranged)
  * handle underflow in fastexp (25% speed penalty, but ubiqituous so necessary)
  * purge last remaining __attribute__ (gcc specific)
  * trade some overall pow2 accuracy to improve accuracy on integral powers

Version 0.1.0
  * Inverse erf
  * Trade some overall log accuracy to improve accuracy on exact powers of 2
  * Whoops, left out power 

Version 0.0.0
  * Fast logarithm, exponential.
  * Fast trigonometrics and hyperbolics.
  * Fast sigmoid and erf.
